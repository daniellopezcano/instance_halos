# instance_halos (ihs)
This repository contains the semantic and instance segmentation models presented in the paper "Characterizing structure formation through instance segmentation". A Jupyter notebook is included for generating example figures analogous to those presented in the paper.

## Software dependencies and datasets
This code uses `tensorflow-gpu`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `networkx`, `jupyter`, `gdown`, and `cython` packages.

The data employed to train and test the networks has been generated using l-gadget3 code [^1] and using a private version of the `bacco` package[^2].

## Code description
The code is organized as follows:
- The `utils_modules` folder contains the codes employed to load the dataset and the model. It also includes the codes employed for performing the pseudo-space clsutering, generate the model predictions, and carry out statistical analysis and plots.
- The `example` folder contains two example Jupyter notebooks (`example.ipynb`, `step_by_step.ipynb`) to see how the models are able to generate predictions and plots similar to those presented in the paper.
- After cloning the huggingface repositiores (see installation instructions below) the folder named `instance_halos_data` will contain .npy files used as example inputs for the networks (also the ground truth predictions). The `instance_halos_models` folder will contain the semantic and instance models stored in a format compatible with tensorflow.

## installation modules
```bash
conda create --name VE_IHs python=3.8
conda activate VE_IHs
conda install -c anaconda tensorflow-gpu
pip install matplotlib scipy networkx cython jupyter gdown
pip install numpy==1.23.5
git clone https://github.com/daniellopezcano/instance_halos.git
cd instance_halos
pip install -e .
gdown --folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MIG_km7KiSP5a75KtRaIeu6U5DcHuIyN?usp=drive_link
gdown --folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YP3wtWEX_4mZPr1N2erRW8OfHU7nmkfW?usp=share_link
```
We had problems using newer numpy versions along with tensorflow-gpu. We recommend employing nmpy v=1.23.5 to avoid these conflicts.

#### profiling
